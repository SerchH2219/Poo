Hello, whoever that is viewing this repository, in the next lines I go to say some aclarations of these practices:

1. The practice 1.1 and 1 is the same, but with a different code, this is because in the class view a diferent way to how do the practice, so the 1.1 is the code that view in class and 1 is the code in the "Reporte sabatico Manual" of the teacher Alexander.

2. The Practice 2 is in the Practice2.md, you need click in the link (is lucichart link) and there are 3 clases in UML (Unified Modeling Language)

3. The files "archivo.txt" and "archivo1.txt" are of the practice 10 and 11, "archivo.txt" is of practice10 and the other of the practice11, so "archivo.txt" have a only -10 number because is part of the practice about the expecions and "archivo1.txt" have 3 names, addres and phones, because is part of the practice about reading and writing files.
